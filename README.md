# Kickstart
A simple starting point for Inktrap website projects.

## Build process
We use Gulp for the compiling templates, Sass and JavaScript as well as image minification.

To install Gulp and its modules navigate to the working directory and then run:

	npm install
	gulp

This will compile everything and then start a local server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the templates.
